## TD Procedure

- Note that only misclick/undos will be ruled locally by the local TDs
- In general, no undos will be allowed unless it is clear that there is a mechanical or software error.
- All other rulings will be referred to the Chief TD, Maurizio, who will rule in consultation with the TDs from both sides.
- If any results are wrong and require changing, please report to your local TD who will then inform the organizers and Chief TD.

## Lineups and Seating
- Teams will submit blind lineups to their local TDs.
- Players will be able to select their seat on the tablet; this should match the submitted lineup. No change of seat is allowed after a player has sat and seen their table opponents (unless the player misclicked on the seat.)
- The deadline for lineup submission is 5 minutes before the start of each round. After this deadline, the TD will release the opponent's seating to the players for them to prepare convention cards for reference.
- Mixed Teams: There is no seating restriction based on gender.

## Match Schedule
- Teams will be seeded for the matchups for Round Robin 2 based on the results of Round Robin 1. 
- The Round Robin 2 schedule will be released no later than 3 hours after the conclusion of Round Robin 1.

All the best to everyone!
